It also connects the data assets used in the accelerator to the WKC business terms.\n\nIn the first part of the notebook category and business terms are imported and then business terms are published into Watson Knowledge Catalog. The category and business terms csvs files are included with the project.\n\nIn the second part of the notebook we programmatically publish a dataset into a catalog and map business terms to the dataset column headers. The business terms and their mappings are specified in a csv file included with the project. The user must first ensure that the catalog exists and the imported business terms have been published.\n\nThe user can also assign business terms to column headers manually or by using the Metadata Enrichment capability within Cloud Pak for Data. \n\nThis notebook is optional. The analytics project runs as expected even if this notebook is not used. \n"}, {"metadata": {"id": "555ab750-fbe3-4f69-af51-a3b6bf575405"}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Create Catalog\n\nThe catalog must be manually created.
